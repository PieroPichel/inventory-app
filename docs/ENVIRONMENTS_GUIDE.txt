Household Inventory App - Dev/Prod Environment Setup Guide
==========================================================

Overview:
---------
This document explains how to create separate development and production environments for the Household Inventory App using Appwrite, Vercel, and Git.

Why Separate Environments:
--------------------------
- Prevent breaking production
- Test safely
- Maintain clean data separation
- Enable preview deployments

Appwrite Setup:
---------------
- Create two Appwrite projects: household_inventory_prod and household_inventory_dev
- Duplicate collections:
    - houses
    - inventory_categories
    - inventory_subcategory
    - inventory_items
    - user_houses
- Ensure permissions match between both projects

Vercel Setup:
-------------
- Add environment variables for both Production and Preview environments:
    - VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT
    - VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT
    - VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE
- Production variables point to prod Appwrite project
- Preview variables point to dev Appwrite project

Git Workflow:
-------------
- Create dev branch:
    git checkout -b dev
- Push to dev:
    git push -u origin dev
- Vercel auto-creates preview deployments
- Merge dev -> main when ready for production:
    git checkout main
    git merge dev
    git push

Environment Variables:
----------------------
Use import.meta.env in appwrite.js:

    const client = new Client()
      .setEndpoint(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT)
      .setProject(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT);

    const DB_ID = import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE;

Domain Setup:
-------------
- Production: inventory.bitswork.net
- Development: inventory-dev.bitswork.net (optional)

Final Checklist:
----------------
- [ ] Two Appwrite projects created
- [ ] Vercel variables configured
- [ ] dev branch created
- [ ] Preview deployments working
- [ ] Production deploys only from main branch
